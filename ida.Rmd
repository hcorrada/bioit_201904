## Interactive Data Analysis

class: split-50

.column[
In general, how do we support interactive data analysis?

Workflow construction: keep pieces small, we like to do that for _reusability_, now let's do it for _data reflection_.

What is the "sufficient statistic" my tool produces that a user can interact with?

**No**. There is (pseudo)-counting, and there is quantification.

Can we produce a "sufficient statistic" we can interact with _before_ quantification.
