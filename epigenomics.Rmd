## What is epigenomics?

---

.center[.image-60[![](img/epi1.png)]]


Genes are **expressed** differently during different **stages** and in different **tissues**.

???

- Something that we want to understand is how that genetic variation leads to phenotypic variation.
- A major part of understanding that, comes from understanding how regulation works.

???

- DNA methylation plays a major role in this regulation process
- Plus, we know how it is inherited from cell to cell, cell-fate
- invovled in differentiation
- can give us an important idea of this process in development and disease
- plasticity

## DNA methylation in cancer

.center[.image-80[![](img/block.png)]]

Large blocks of **hypo-methylation** in colon cancer

- consistent partially methylated in normal tissues
- cancer levels are inconsistent, boundaries conserved across samples
- overlaps with other important genomic domains
- genes within these blocks are **tissue-specific**

## Summary

- large domains of methylation loss are a stable mark across cancer types

--
exclude: true
- gene expression hyper-variability is enriched within these domains

--
exclude: true
- hyper-variable genes within these regions are tissue-specific and involved in cellular fate
